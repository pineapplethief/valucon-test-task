Hi, I'm Ruby on Rails developer with 2+ years of hands-on experience building web-sites, single page applications and API's of all kinds. Here are some highlights of my skills:

Back-end:
* Ruby 2.0-2.3.
* Deep interest in OOP techniques for low-coupled, high-cohesion, modular code. SOLID, patterns of refactoring, clean code. Strict adherence to code style.
* Rails 3/4/5.
* Experience creating(via rails-api, activemodel-serialisers) and consuming API's of all kinds.
* Experience with tons of useful gems: devise, pundit, activeadmin, simple_form, kaminari, virtus, and so on and so forth.
* Experience creating my own gems and patching 3rd party gems.
* Proficiency with relational databases (mostly Postgres now, although I've worked with mySQL too), understanding of database indices, ability to write complex SQL queries, solid knowledge of ActiveRecord.
* Redis for caching.
* Experience with TDD(RSpec) and BDD(RSpec, capybara) approaches to software development.
* Deploying rails apps to VPS and Heroku, capistrano/mina, ansible for provisioning.

Front-end:
* HTML5/ERB/HAML/SLIM.
* CSS3/SASS/SCSS/PostCSS.
* BEM-like methodologies.
* Mobile-first layouts.
* Experience with popular front-end frameworks(Bootstrap 3/4, Bourbon+Neat, Semantic UI).
* Javascript (both ES5 and ES6), jQuery, React+Redux+Immutable.js(my favourite front-end stack).
* Experience with modern front-end toolchain (npm + webpack) and writing modular javascript code.

Tooling:
* git, github, pull requests, git flow.
* JIRA, Trello for task management.
* Slack, Skype for communication.
* Skype or Screenhero for paired programming.

Soft-skills:
* Understanding that business goals come first.
* Dislike for re-inventing the wheel.
* Ability to learn new technologies fast.
* Honesty in giving estimates.
* Reliable and marathon-like in terms of velocity.

I can send/show samples of my code if you are interested. I'm also definitely open to test task so you could evaluate my skills and see if I'm a fit for your project.

I'm looking forward to working with you,
Aleksey.
